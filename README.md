# Interview Helper

Through my time between school and finding a job, I realized there are a load of resources available to help me study for interviews; however, one thing that was difficult was creating an overall time schedule. A crash course you could say into preparing you. Plans are at the moment to make one that helps you get through a certain number of tasks in a day, but later on I am thinking of adding in analytics if enough users use this. This can help give better estimates.
